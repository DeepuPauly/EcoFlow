In designing the landing page for EcoFlow, my approach centered on creating a visually appealing and functional layout that adapts seamlessly across different devices.
I used responsive design principles to ensure that the page looks great on various screen sizes, from desktops to mobile phones.
Key strategies included using flexible grid layouts with percentages for width and incorporating media queries to adjust font sizes and element dimensions based on the screen width.
I also utilized a mobile-first approach, designing for smaller screens first and progressively enhancing the design for larger displays.

To handle responsiveness, I applied CSS flexbox for aligning and distributing space among items within containers, ensuring a smooth and consistent layout.
For challenges, I encountered issues with image sizing and text readability on smaller screens.
These were addressed by setting maximum widths for images and adjusting font sizes within media queries to maintain readability.
Additionally, I used viewport units and percentages for padding and margins to ensure that the hero section and other key elements resize proportionally to the screen size.
